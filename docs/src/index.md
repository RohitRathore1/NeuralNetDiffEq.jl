# NeuralPDE.jl: Scientific Machine Learning for Partial Differential Equations

NeuralPDE.jl is a solver package which consists neural network solvers for
partial differential equations using scientific machine learning (SciML)
techniques such as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and deep
BSDE solvers. This package utilizes deep neural networks and
neural stochastic differential equations to solve high dimensional PDEs
at a greatly reduced cost and greatly increased generality compared to classical methods.

## Features

- Physics-Informed Neural Networks for automated PDE solving
- Forward-Backwards Stochastic Differential Equation (FBSDE) methods for parabolic PDEs
- Deep learning based solvers for optimal stopping time and Kolmogorov backwards equations
